  This work is inspired by OmniGraffle Equation support:
  http://macinscience.org/?p=12


* Requirements:

	Ruby 1.9
	latex	(LaTeX2e)
	dvips
	epstopdf

Assuming latex, dvips and epstopdf are in invoker's shell path.


* Running:

Run by

   ruby extmath.rb TeX-Files

Default action is, scan given TeX file and creating PDF file in ./Temp
directory, one by one, under the name with the hash(MD5) value of the
TeX representation of the symbol. For example,

    C_n

will generate

    0a22604c6270cafda16d1bee51963ab4.pdf

Note that, C_n and C_{n} will create same output but this program does
not detect braces nor spaces which TeX will ignore in glyph sense, but
it will cause create different file.  Note that multiple white-spaces
in the expression are compressed into single space, before use as
symbol value.

All of the mapping of the hash (file name and the symbol will be
written in symbol-map.txt file. This file contains tab separated values
of hash value and the symbol, in the order of hash (alphabetically sorted).

Additionally, you can create math-preamble.tex in the PDF output
directory which will be included in the preamble of each TeX run (file
name can be specified via -i option). Using this, you can use some
macros in the math descriptions.


* Options

-F, --force                      Force recreate all files

  By default, this program do not re-create PDF if there is one for that 
  symbol. This option override that behavior to force create all outputs.
  (Since file name is created from hash of the TeX math representation,
   it is safe to assume output is same unless resolution parameter is same)

-N, --no-map                     Don't create math-index.map file

  Do not create math-index.map file


-m, --map MAP                    create map file with name (Default: symbol-map.txt)

  Specify file name of the file name to symbol map text file and create it


-s, --size SIZE                  specify size parameter (default:Huge)

  Specify the font parameter to be used. Use LaTeX size spec here


-r, --resolution RESOLUTION      Output resolution (default:600)

  Specify the output resolution in dots per inch, which passed to dvips command.


-p, --path PATH                  Directory to generate PDF (default: ./Temp)

  Specify the path of the directory for the output.


-i, --include PREAMBLE           Include this file in TeX preamble if exists (default: math-preamble.tex)

  Specify the file to be included as the preamble section of TeX file to be processed, 
  if the file exists.   You can specify macros and such in this file.


-T, --retain-tex                 Retain TeX output file

  Don't remove .tex file after processing.


-E, --retain-ps                  Retain PS output file

  Don't remove .ps file after processing


-P, --no-pdf                     don't output PDF file

  Don't create PDF files. You may combine -E -P to create PostScript file only.


-J, --japanese                   Configure for Japanese environment

  Use 'platex' instead of 'latex'
  

-L, --by-line                    Output only by line in eqnarray
-B, --by-box                     Output only by box in eqnarray
-A, --by-box-line                Output both box and line-by-line in eqnarray
-I, --by-box-line-item	         Output each item in eqnarray row/column

  By default all of the eqnarray output will be generated per eqnarray block.
  -L force output by line by line only. -B specify output in box only(default)
  And -A output both boxes and lines, -S output boxes, lines and items.


* Japanese Support

Use '-J' option to use platex instead of latex. The code have support
for character encodings, but it is currently configured to treat all
external files as binary file and does not translate any.


* MacOS X NOTE
   I observed if I open folder which is the target folder of this script,
   Finder of the Snow Leopard might stop responding, while it is keep trying
   to detect status of appearing/disappearing of temporary files. If
   such happen, just re-launch Finder.



* TODO:

- Possibly provide support for other eqnarray like environment.
