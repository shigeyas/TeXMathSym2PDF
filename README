  This work is inspired by OmniGraffle Equasion support:
  http://macinscience.org/?p=12


* Requirments:

	Ruby 1.9
	latex	(LaTeX2e)
	dvips
	epstopdf

Assuming latex, dvips and epstopdf are in invoker's shell path.


* To Execute:

Run:

   ruby extmath.rb --help

to see help. Default is, scan given TeX file and creating PDF file in
./Temp directory, one by one, under the name with the hash(MD5) value
of the TeX representation of the symbol. For example,

    C_n

will generate

    0a22604c6270cafda16d1bee51963ab4.pdf

Note that, C_n and C_{n} will look same but this program does not
detech such braces nor spaces, effectively create different file.


All of the mapping of the hash (filename and the symbol will be
written in symbol-map.txt file. This file contains tab separated values
of hash value and the symbol, in the order of hash (alphabetically sorted).

Additionally, you can create math-preamble.tex in the PDF output
directory which will be included in the preamble of each TeX run (file
name can be specified via -i option). Using this, you can use some
macros in the math descriptions.


* MacOS X NOTE
   I observed if I open folder which is the target folder of this script,
   Finder of the Snow Leopard might stop responding, while it is keep trying
   to detect status of appearing/disappearing of temporary files. If
   such happen, just re-launch Finder.



* TODO:

- Support for eqnarray will come soon.
